# Create a registration form

Implement the form in a Vue project matching the design as close as possible.
Keeping good user experience in mind, we need to validate the data and guide the users if they enter invalid information.

- use any version of Vue (2, 3)
- use your own colors if you'd like
- you may use the same icon for all fields to not waste time (provided)
- native radio and checkbox inputs are a bit odd. can you make them look better?
- it would be nice to allow the user to toggle password visibility
- figure out a way to let the user know where they made a mistake
- validate the data at each step and display it at the end as if you would be sending it to the server (a simple alert will do)
- validations: required, min length, password match, terms and conditions accepted
- the form should be responsive, perhaps a single column on small screens.
